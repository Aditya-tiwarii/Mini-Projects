                October 1931 – 27
                July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came
                to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
